###Q1

#Full disclosure: this is code I used from an earlier lab

#Task: Let's make a full list of buyers for a certain

#1.
moco_monthly_buyers_2012 <-combined_buyer_monthly(county="Montgomery", state="MD", year = 2012, key = key)
#view(moco_monthly_buyers_2012)
 
#we'd want to do this for every year, but I picked 2012 completely arbitrarily
#now, this only tells us the DEA no, so we need a join. 


#2.
#let's actually make a new object to join
moco_buyer_details <- buyer_details(county="Montgomery", state="MD", key = key)
#view(moco_buyer_details)

#still don't have the year, but at least this matches a name to the DEA no.

#3.

#im not gonna pay attention to the dosage column here, as its functionally useless



```

###Q2

#Task: Can we make a full address list for that buyer variable we just made?

#First off
clean_names(moco_buyers_2012_detailed)

#ok now

view(moco_2012_working)

#cool! it seems to have worked.
